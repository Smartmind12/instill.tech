ðŸ’§ [**Instill VDP**](https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp), or **VDP (Versatile Data Pipeline)**, is no-code/low-code pipeline builder that allows you to build, test, release and share AI workflows for unstructured data.
It empowers you to rapidly develop versatile AI capabilities with exceptional speed.

If your goal is to develop versatile AI features using Large Language Models (LLM), Generative AI, Vision, or Audio models, Instill VDP empowers you to:

- Effortlessly **connect** to your unstructured data
- **Build** pipelines to enable diverse AI functionalities in your applications
- Visually **test** pipelines with a single click, viewing output at each stage
- Easily **share** your pipelines to showcase your work

### Pipeline

The foundation of VDP lies in the concept of a **Pipeline**, which comprises connectors and operators, all defined within a `recipe`.
A pipeline can be triggered using either SYNC APIs (for synchronous responses) or ASYNC APIs (ideal for long-running workloads).
More detailed information about pipelines can be found in the [Pipeline](pipeline) section.

The implementation of the Pipeline concept is managed in the [pipeline-backend](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend) repository.

#### Component

A **Component** is a fundamental building block used to construct a pipeline in VDP.
The system offers various types of components, each catering to specific functionalities.
Components empower VDP pipelines to perform unstructured data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). We have two types of component: **Connector** and **Operator**.

#### Connector

To connect numerous providers of abilities around the world, **Connector** is introduced.
Connectors allow users to connect to different types of providers and vendors.
These tasks encompass data extraction, transformation using AI models, and uploading to blockchains, third-party apps, or data warehouses.

#### Operator

To facilitate more flexible and fine-grained data injection and manipulation, **Operator** is introduced.
Operators allow users to run customized code without the need for server management or pre-provisioning.
This enables code execution whenever the pipeline is triggered and data flows into the connector.

### Console

**Console** is a web-based UI application, designed to provide convenient access to Base, VDP and Model.
One of its key features is a _no-code_ drag-and-drop pipeline builder.
This means that even non-technical users can effortlessly build flexible VDP pipelines by simply dragging and dropping components.
By emphasizing simplicity and ease of use, the goal is to provide a unified and intuitive user experience.

Console is maintained in [console](https://github.com/instill-ai/console).

### API

VDP is implemented with **API-first** design principle. It enables seamless integration to your data stack at any scale.

VDP uses [Protocol Buffers version 3 (proto3)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages.
The same interface definitions are used for both REST (via [gRPC-Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway)) and RPC. This enables the access to the API over different protocols:

- JSON over HTTP
- Protocol Buffers over gRPC

The interface definitions are maintained in [protobufs](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs) with auto-generated Go codes in [protogen-go](https://github.com/instill-ai/protogen-go) and Python code in [protogen-python](https://github.com/instill-ai/protogen-python).
The genuine protobuf documentation can be found in our [Buf Scheme Registry (BSR)](https://buf.build/instill-ai/protobufs).
