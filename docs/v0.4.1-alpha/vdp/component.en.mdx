A **Component** is a fundamental building block used to construct a pipeline in VDP. VDP has two types of **Components**: **Connectors** and **Operators**. The system offers various types of **Connectors** and **Operators**, each catering to specific functionalities:

- [**AI Connector**](../connectors/overview#ai-connector): Connect to remote models from model providers like Instill Model, OpenAI, Stability AI, etc.
- [**Data Connector**](../connectors/overview#data-connector): Connect to remote data sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Pinecone, etc.
- [**App Connector**](../connectors/overview#app-connectors): Connect to 3rd-party services like Numbers, etc.
- [**Operator**](/docs/vdp/operators): Facilitate more flexible and fine-grained data injection and manipulation.
- ...

Each type of connector requires specific configuration to connect to the respective remote service.

Connector is served by the [`connector-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend), [`pipeline-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend) will communicate with [`connector-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-backend) via gRPC.
Operator is directly served by the [`pipeline-backend`](https://github.com/instill-ai/pipeline-backend).

## Definition

VDP uses [`ConnectorDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/connector/v1alpha/connector_definition.proto) and [`OperatorDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/pipeline/v1alpha/operator_definition.proto)
to define the basic properties and detailed configuration of a connector or a operator.
The inner field [`connector_definition.spec.connection_specification`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/connector/v1alpha/spec.proto)
defines the connector configuration JSON Schema, including resource configuration, component configuration and OpenAPI schemas.
The inner field [`operator_definition.spec.connection_specification`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/vdp/pipeline/v1alpha/operator_definition.proto)
defines the operator configuration JSON Schema, including component configuration and OpenAPI schemas.

## Release stage

For Instill AI developed and maintained components, we use release stage defined as below to indicate their readiness:

| Stage                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alpha**               | An alpha component indicates that it is under development, and Instill AI is actively collecting early feedback and issues reported by early adopters. Alpha components are not recommended for production use.                                                              |
| **Beta**                | A beta component is considered stable and reliable, with no further backwards incompatible changes expected. However, it may not have been tested by a large user base. Beta releases are intended to identify and fix any remaining issues before moving to the next stage. |
| **Generally Available** | A generally available component has undergone thorough testing and is ready for use in production environments. Its documentation is considered sufficient to support widespread adoption.                                                                                   |

Feel free to explore VDP and leverage its open components to build AI-first applications for unstructured data processing.

## AI Connector

The **AI Connector** provides an integration framework to connect AI models from various sources,
no matter first-party ModelOps platform **Instill Model** and third-party model vendors, as well as in-house model serving platforms.

The AI connectors play a crucial role in VDP pipelines to transform unstructured data into meaningful and analysable representations,
making it easier to extract valuable insights.

Here is a list of the supported AI connectors that you can leverage for your projects. You can find detailed information about each connector in the [connector-ai](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-ai) repository:

- [Instill Model](instill-model)
- [Stability AI](stability-ai)
- [OpenAI](openai)
- ðŸ”œ **Hugging Face**

## Data Connector

**Data Connectors** play a crucial role in establishing connections with remote data sources, such as IoT devices (e.g., IP cameras), cloud storage services (e.g., GCP Cloud Storage, AWS S3), data warehouses, or vector databases.

These connectors act as the bridge between VDP and various external data sources.
Their primary function is to enable seamless data exchange, enhancing VDP's capability to work with diverse data sources effectively.
The VDP community is continuously working to expand the range of available connectors.
Detailed information about each specific connector is available in the [connector-data](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-data) repository:

- [Pinecone](pinecone)
- [Airbyte Data Connectors](airbyte)
- [BigQuery](bigquery)
- [Google Cloude Storage (GCS)](gcs)
- ðŸ”œ **AWS S3**
- ðŸ”œ **Snowflake**
- ðŸ”œ **Milvus**

## App Connector

The App Connector is to seamlessly integrate various 3rd-party application services.

Here is a list of the supported connectors that you can leverage for your projects. You can find detailed information about each connector in the connector-blockchain repository:

- [Numbers Protocol](numbers-protocol)

## Operator

To facilitate more flexible and fine-grained data injection and manipulation, **Operators** allow users to run data manipulation without the need for server management or pre-provisioning.

Currently, VDP supports the following operators:

- [**Start**](start)
- [**End**](end)
- [**Base64**](base64)
- [**JSON**](json)
- [**REST**](rest)
- [**Text Extraction**](textextraction)
- The list is growing ... ðŸŒ±
