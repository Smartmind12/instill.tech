No matter where your model stores, we want to keep your models in the same place without changes and make the process of importing the models into Instill Model very easy.
That's why Instill Model has integrated many model platforms and tools as _model sources_. We strive to support as many popular _model sources_ as possible.

A _model source_ in Instill Model is defined by [`ModelDefinition`](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/blob/main/model/model/v1alpha/model_definition.proto). The JSON Schema of a `ModelDefinition` defines how to configure and import a _model source_.
Currently, Instill Model supports importing models using the following sources:

- [ArtiVC](artivc)
- [GitHub](github)
  - Track model files using [Git-LFS](/docs/import-models/github#prepare-a-github-repository-and-track-large-model-files-by-git-lfs)
  - Track model files using [DVC](/docs/import-models/github#prepare-a-github-repository-and-manage-large-model-files-by-dvc)
- [Hugging Face](huggingface)
- [Local](local)

If you'd like to **ask for a new model definition**, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/instill-ai/community/issues) or
request it in the **#give-feedback** channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sevxWsqpGh).

## Release stage

We use release stage to indicate a model source's readiness.

| Stage                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Alpha**               | An alpha component indicates that it is under development, and Instill AI is actively collecting early feedback and issues reported by early adopters. Alpha components are not recommended for production use.                                                              |
| **Beta**                | A beta component is considered stable and reliable, with no further backwards incompatible changes expected. However, it may not have been tested by a large user base. Beta releases are intended to identify and fix any remaining issues before moving to the next stage. |
| **Generally Available** | A generally available component has undergone thorough testing and is ready for use in production environments. Its documentation is considered sufficient to support widespread adoption.                                                                                   |
